In November 2014 we were experienceing a low activity period for the tech team over at The World Loves. Together with my colleuge (and former classmate) [Jonatan Pettersson][jonjon] I set out to learn something new. We decided to make an iOS app in Swift, mostly since neither of us had done one before and Swift was growing as a language.

##Introducing Alchemist
Our idea was simple – we should start out as we started out with Javascript. Making a product that simply wrapped open API's and presented it's information in a collected way. An aggregator, of sorts.

I had recently started using an awesome service called [TasteKid][tastekid] that recommends media to a users liking. You post a title and get recommendations back. They just happened to have an open API so we decided to simply work around that.

##Development
Controlled by apple

###Constrained by constraints
wtf

###JSON is a bitch
Well, json is definitely more fun in Javascript. 

##Summary
The app is available for download over at the [app store][app] if you want to try it out.

We're yet to open source the code, but we only need to exclude our api keys for that to be done. If there's any interest in looking at our code you simply just need to tell us.
