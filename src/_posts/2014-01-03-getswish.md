The first project I got to do when I started at [The World Loves][twl] in April 2014 was the website for Swish. Swish is the largest mobile payment provider in Sweden, with over 2 800 000 users (as of july 2015). That's kind of a lot for a country that has under 10 million inhabitants.

[GetSwish.se][swish] remains the largest website I've developed with over 180k visits each month.

*The carousel was made with facebooks paper campaign site as inspiration. It's not totally enjoyable in gif-form, [check it out live][swish]!*

*The front page grid was made to feel alive, so each month we posted new statistics about Swish.*

*We tried giving the image headers parallax effect so that the website wouldn't feel to static on the subpages.*

## Tools
The website is running on wordpress. I was heavily invested in finding a CMS that did exactly what we needed it to, but in the end Wordpress was the best fit due to our experience with developing for it. The simplicity for administrators was also a big thing. 

For easy development we were using git for versioning and grunt with sass(scss compass), htmlmin and require.js(with r.js) for packaging. Grunt would also detect changes to the images to see if they needed compression or in the case of svg's, minification.

When it comes to css grid, we actually used one I made myself just for that project. It's a basic setup with adjustable columns and gutter width, written in scss. 

## Optimization
Due to the very content heavy first page we base64 encoded most of the imagery to load in more high res images as they were needed. This strategy allowed for a much quicker pageload, and created a natural evaluation point to check if we should feed the client a regular resolution image or a retina version of it. 

Scrolling performance was also a high priority during development, so all scroll listeners were throttled to 60fps and we made sure never to change values for javascript animated items when they were not in the viewport. Minimizing dom manipulations were a priority from day one.

The site also featured the standard "run-of-the-mill" optimizations such as compression and minification of assets, gzip compression, varnish, etc.

## Deploys
We used git for all deploys. We had a grunt task set up for version tagging and automatically merging all the tagged commits to the release branch. We'd then ssh into the hosting server and simply run a git pull from the repository directory.
