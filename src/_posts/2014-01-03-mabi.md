My first live project using Angular.js was the website for [Mabi][mabi], one of the top rental car companies in Sweden. It was the biggest assignments I had over at [River][river] apart from a iAd campaign I did for Nike. I was the sole front end developer on this project, but some advanced features like figuring out the rules for the car filtration was definitely a team effort.

*Mabi had a lot of good imagery the designers could blow up for the banners.*

*The car filtration is where I definitely learned the most about directives as components, how ng-reapeats work as well as the limitations of angular.*

*A customized google map that shows the closest rental spots was also a fun and quick exersice.* 

The site's changed a lot since I left River in early 2014, but if you still want to check it out, just go to [Mabi.se.][mabi]. A heads up though â€“ it doesn't seem like there's support for higher resolutions than 1080p any more, so the background image is ugly if you're on a big screen.
