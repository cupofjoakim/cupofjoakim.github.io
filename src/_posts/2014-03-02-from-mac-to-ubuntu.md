title: From Mac to Ubuntu

excerpt: "Linux is everywhere. It's on our servers, in our virtual machines and on our game consoles. I set out into a journey to see if I could replace OS X with a new version of Ubuntu and still work as a front-end developer effectively. Spoiler: It's almost possible."

When I grew up in the woods of Sweden I often entertained myself through going on various nerdy endeavours. I read fantasy novels, played Dungeons and Dragons and even melted my moms' motherboard after overclocking the integrated graphics card too much. Sorry mom.

I also tried out Linux a couple of times. Every time I did I would get really excited while the chosen distro was downloading â€“ only to be upset when I failed to install the propper drivers or fucked something else up. 

Fast forward to 2015. I've now been working as a front-end developer for a couple of years. Linux distros seem to have matured quite a bit. Some governmental institutions are actually [replacing Windows desktops with Ubuntu](http://www.linuxinsider.com/rsstory/74715.html)! Almost all the tools I use are built in ruby and node, both of which are available in linux. Could I replace my OS X life with Ubuntu? Experimention time!

## Installing the OS
For the sake of the safety (and my job) I used my stationary desktop computer for the experiment. It's two years Old, but is running Windows 10 with a haswell processor and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 760.

## Setting up for development

* Git
* Node
* Ruby
* Sublime Text
* PHP

## Extra: Non-work use
You can't work all the time

### Multimedia
Thank god for HTML5 Video.

### Gaming
Well, the library of Linux friendly steam titles are definitely growing.
