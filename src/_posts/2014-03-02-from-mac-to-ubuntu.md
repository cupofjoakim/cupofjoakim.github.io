title: From Mac to Ubuntu - Evaluation
categories: articles
type: article
excerpt: "Linux is everywhere. It's on our servers, in our virtual machines and on our game consoles. I set out into a journey to see if I could replace OS X with a new version of Ubuntu and still work as a front-end developer effectively. Spoiler: It's almost possible."

When I grew up in the woods of Sweden I often entertained myself through going on various nerdy endeavours. I read fantasy novels, played Dungeons and Dragons and even melted my moms' motherboard after overclocking the integrated graphics card too much. Sorry mom. I also tried out Linux a couple of times. Every time I did I would get really excited while the chosen distro was downloading – only to be upset when I failed to install the propper drivers or fucked something else up. 

Fast forward to 2015. I've now been working as a front-end developer for a couple of years. Linux distros seem to have matured quite a bit. Some governmental institutions are actually [replacing Windows desktops with Ubuntu](http://www.linuxinsider.com/rsstory/74715.html)! Almost all the tools I use are built in ruby and node, both of which are available in linux. Could I replace my OS X life with Ubuntu? Experimention time!

## Installing the OS
For the sake of the safety (and my job) I used my stationary desktop computer for the experiment. It's two years Old, but is running a haswell processor and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 760 with a couple of SSD's and modern gigabit motherboard with support for wifi.

The installation went very smoothly and I got up and running without any real problems, except for the video drivers. Ubuntu installed some basic driver which worked perfectly, but I couldn't really get all that performance from my card. I figured I should try to get the official Nvidia drivers up and running, but that was like opening the gates to hell. The computer wouldn't boot past the GRUB OS selection screen for ubuntu and I was greeted with a black screen. I tried resetting and retrying the installation a few times with a couple of recommended older versions of the drivers but it all ended the same way. I finally gave up – I don't really need the extra performance either way.

## Setting up for development
Since the nature of my projects varies a lot there's a lot of stuff I can't really work without. 

* Git
* Node
* Ruby
* Sublime Text
* PHP
* Vagrant

## Extra: Non-work use
You can't work all the time.

### Making it feel good
I'm a heavy user of multiple workspaces in OS X, s

### Multimedia
Thank god for HTML5 Video. Flash seems to be a natural enemy in linux environments.

### Gaming
Well, the library of Linux friendly steam titles are definitely growing.
