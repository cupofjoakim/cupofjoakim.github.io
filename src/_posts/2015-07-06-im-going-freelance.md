It's finally decided. I'm going freelance in august. Being a web developer has never been more exciting!

*How I'll look in august when I'm about to make the switch.*

## Why?
I'm getting more contracting requests than I can handle outside a regular job, so the natural step is to **make it** my regular job.

## What services will you provide?

* Front End Development
* Wordpress Development
* Web Design
* Technological Audits
* Accessibility Audits
* SEO Audits

I can help you out with loads of stuff, these being a few of them. I'd also be happy to help you out with technical advise for whatever project you have in mind. Sometimes you might just need someone to discuss your idea with to see if it's good or not.
 
I have a big network of friends and colleagues if you need help with anything else in the digital production or digital strategy sphere.

## Why should I hire you?
I'm good at what I do. Also because I'm great at teamwork, good at making informed decisions and I'm a hard worker.

## Can you make \<project\> for us?
Probably. [Send me a message][msg] or [call me][cell] and tell me about the project and we'll talk about it.
