excerpt: "A WWF fashion campaign site for fur from imaginary animals. Built early 2013."
---

During my internship at Stink Digital back in late 2012 I was part of the two man developer team who built the Wonder World Fur campaign site for the [World Wildlife Foundation][wwf](WWF). Wonder World Fur was a brand where WWF sold furs from 100% imaginary animals.

Our team consisted of [Ian Hart][ian] and me from the London office and [Charlie Montagut][charlie] from the then newly opened Paris office. I was in charge of most of the front-end. The Project was awarded with a [FWA SOTD award in April 2013][fwa].

*The site in itself used autoplaying fullscreen videos. These ranged from subtle cinemagraphs to the campaign trailer.*

![Wonder World Fur used a grid to let imagery speak instead of text.]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/post-images/wwf-grid.jpg)
*The site also featured some very balanced animations for entry and hover effects to highlight the imagery and the products. These can't be showcased propperly since no screen recordings from when the site was up has been saved.*

*Each of the imaginary animals had information panels where you could learn more about them. You could watch a 3D-rendered video to see what they would look like in action, listen to the different sounds the animal could make or just read a description.*

The site has sadly gone off the web since it was online, but you could still see it it's FWA award: http://www.thefwa.com/site/wonder-world-fur
