We've also added a lot of different settings for [Redcarpet][redcarpet],
including being able to ^superscript, _underline_, ==highlight==,
~~strikethrough~~, and footnotes.[^1] It even automatically makes links into
URLs: www.jekyllrb.com and you can put multiple underscores in words without
them leaning all over the place: this_word_has_underscores. It'll also make your
quotes look nice, like this: "hoho", your dashes and hypens will be dashing too:
---/--.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var definition = 0;

var functionOfImportance = function(){
  console.log("shitdickles");  
};
{% endhighlight %}
