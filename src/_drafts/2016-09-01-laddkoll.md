[Laddkoll][laddkoll] is a swedish startup making it easier for electrical vehicle owners to charge their cars. They do this by providing both a localization service so the user easily can find a charge point, and by providing a simple way for the user to pay for both the parking and the actual charge.

When I "arrived at the scene", there was two code bases to maintain. A native iOS version that worked really well and a less performant android version built on top on [React Native][rn]. The scope of the job was to refactor and improve the React Native version to such a degree that we could replace the iOS version with it. The motivation behind this was to lessen the amount of hours needed to maintain the both apps, and to streamline development since the Laddkoll team was small.

During the job we realized that React Native brought a whole lot more benefits than we usually thought. One of them was that it made it possible for services such as [code-push][codepush] to deliver updates to the app without going through App Store or Google Play Store. This is a major feature and makes it easy for a small team to get important bug fixes out, so we implemented it very quickly.

If you want to know more about the actual product, download it and try it out! It's on [Google Play Store][playstore] and the [App Store][appstore].

This was my first forage into the world of React Native and I've got to say that I'm impressed. I've made a couple of apps before, but this is by far the most pleasant developer experience I've had. The only problems I've run into is third party libraries that weren't working properly, and I can't really blame that on the RN team. I'm already using React Native for a couple of other projects and I'm excited to see where it is going next.
