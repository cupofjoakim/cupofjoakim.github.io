Together with my colleague (and former classmate) <a href="http://karlerikjonatan.github.io/">Jonatan Pettersson</a> I set out to learn something new. We decided to make an iOS app in Swift, mostly since neither of us had done one before and Swift was growing as a language.</p><h2>Introducing Alchemist</h2><p>Our idea was simple – we should start out as we started out with javascript. Making a product that simply wrapped open API&rsquo;s and presented it&rsquo;s information in a collected way. An aggregator, of sorts.</p><p>I had recently started using an awesome service called <a href=https://tastekid.com>TasteKid</a> that recommends media to a users liking. You post a title and get recommendations back. They just happened to have an open API so we decided to simply work around that.</p><h2>Constrained by constraints</h2><p>Confession time: I&rsquo;ve never developed a GUI that didn&rsquo;t rely on CSS and HTML before making this app, and I&rsquo;ve still never tried flexbox in CSS. Constraints was a totally new concept for me.</p><p>I think I did get a hang for it pretty quickly though, mostly thanks to <a href="http://www.appcoda.com/introduction-auto-layout/">this article over at appcoda.com</a> and the video tutorials over at [Team Treehouse]. I&rsquo;m still not convinced it&rsquo;s the best way of specifying UI layouts, but then again – CSS is even more shit than this. I did miss the styling parts from CSS though.</p><h2>JSON is a bitch</h2><p>Well, turns out we web developers are spoiled brats.</p><p>Navigating JSON is such a breeze in javascript that I&rsquo;ve never given it any thought on how weird it can be in other languages. We spent the better part of a day together just trying to figure it out, and we ended up using the <a href=https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON>SwiftJSON library</a> because it made it so much easier. Our app was so reliant on JSON sources (themoviedb, goodreads, youtube, tastekid, etc.) that this was a major life saver.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>We learned a lot and gained some valuable understanding on how different things are over in app-land. While iOS dev&rsquo;s have stuff like CocoaPods, the tooling isn&rsquo;t like the web development scene at all. It might be because everything is so controlled by Apple and that xCode in itself functions like a framework. While <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> might change the environment somewhat it&rsquo;s still going to be a bit lack-luster. I like to be able to choose what way I want to develop a product, but in iOS there&rsquo;s mostly just one way.</p><p>That being said, Swift isn&rsquo;t really harder than regular web front end technologies if you&rsquo;re doing it at a basic level. Apple are literally giving you almost all the tools you need. I&rsquo;ll try to make another app once I&rsquo;ve got enough free time to try out React Native.</p><p>The app is available for download over at the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=942473452&amp;mt=8">app store</a> if you want to try it out.</p></div></div></article></div><script src=/assets/javascript/bundle.js></script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
